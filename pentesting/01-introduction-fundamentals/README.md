# 01. Introduction & Fundamentals

## Overview

This section covers the fundamental concepts, methodologies, and types of penetration testing. Understanding these basics is essential before diving into specific testing techniques.

## Core Concepts

### Penetration Testing Definition
Penetration testing (pen testing) is an authorized simulated cyberattack performed to evaluate the security of a system, network, or application.

### Ethical Hacking
Ethical hacking involves legally breaking into systems to identify vulnerabilities and security weaknesses, with explicit permission from the system owner.

## Security Assessment Types

### Black Box Testing
- **Definition**: Testing with no prior knowledge of the system
- **Advantages**: Simulates real-world attacker perspective
- **Disadvantages**: May miss internal vulnerabilities
- **Use Case**: External security assessments

### White Box Testing
- **Definition**: Testing with full knowledge of system architecture and source code
- **Advantages**: Comprehensive coverage, finds logical flaws
- **Disadvantages**: Doesn't simulate real attacker
- **Use Case**: Internal security audits, code reviews

### Gray Box Testing
- **Definition**: Testing with partial knowledge (e.g., user credentials, limited documentation)
- **Advantages**: Balanced approach, realistic scenarios
- **Disadvantages**: Requires careful scope definition
- **Use Case**: Most common in real-world engagements

## Penetration Testing Methodologies

### OWASP Testing Guide
- Web application security testing framework
- Focuses on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- [Official Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)

### PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)
- Comprehensive methodology covering all phases
- 7 main phases: Pre-engagement, Intelligence Gathering, Threat Modeling, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, Post-Exploitation, Reporting
- [Official Standard](http://www.pentest-standard.org/)

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Risk-based approach to cybersecurity
- Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- [NIST Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)

### OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)
- Scientific methodology for security testing
- Focuses on operational security
- [OSSTMM](http://www.isecom.org/research.html)

## Rules of Engagement (ROE)

ROE document should include:
- Scope of testing (in-scope and out-of-scope systems)
- Testing windows and time restrictions
- Contact information
- Emergency procedures
- Data handling requirements
- Reporting requirements

## Scope Definition

Clear scope definition prevents:
- Legal issues
- Service disruption
- Scope creep
- Unauthorized access

## Authorization & Legal Considerations

### Required Documentation
- Written authorization letter
- Scope of work agreement
- Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)
- Insurance coverage

### Legal Requirements
- Always obtain written permission
- Understand local and international laws
- Comply with data protection regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Maintain confidentiality

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Levels
- **Critical**: Immediate threat to business operations
- **High**: Significant security impact
- **Medium**: Moderate security concern
- **Low**: Minor security issue
- **Informational**: Best practice recommendation

## Threat Modeling

### STRIDE Model
- **S**poofing
- **T**ampering
- **R**epudiation
- **I**nformation Disclosure
- **D**enial of Service
- **E**levation of Privilege

## Testing Types

### External Penetration Testing
- Tests external-facing systems
- Simulates external attacker
- Focuses on perimeter security

### Internal Penetration Testing
- Tests internal network security
- Simulates insider threat
- Tests internal controls

### Network Penetration Testing
- Focuses on network infrastructure
- Tests firewalls, routers, switches
- Network segmentation testing

### Application Penetration Testing
- Tests application security
- Web, mobile, desktop applications
- API security testing

### Physical Security Testing
- Tests physical security controls
- Access control systems
- Social engineering (physical)

### Red Team Exercises
- Full-spectrum adversary simulation
- Multi-stage attack scenarios
- Tests detection and response

### Purple Team Exercises
- Collaboration between red and blue teams
- Real-time feedback
- Improves security posture

### Blue Team Exercises
- Defensive security exercises
- Incident response drills
- Security monitoring

## Code Examples

### Python Examples

- `roe_template_generator.py` - ROE document generator
- `risk_assessment_calculator.py` - Risk scoring calculator

### Node.js Examples

## Best Practices

1. Always obtain written authorization
2. Define clear scope boundaries
3. Document everything
4. Follow responsible disclosure
5. Maintain confidentiality
6. Test in isolated environments when possible
7. Have emergency contacts ready
8. Follow a recognized methodology
