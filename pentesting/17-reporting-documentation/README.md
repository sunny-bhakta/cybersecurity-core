# 17. Reporting & Documentation

## Overview

Effective reporting and documentation are critical components of penetration testing. This section covers report structure, documentation best practices, and reporting tools.

## Report Components

### Executive Summary
- High-level overview
- Business impact
- Key findings
- Risk summary

### Technical Findings
- Detailed vulnerability descriptions
- Proof of concept
- Impact assessment
- Affected systems

### Risk Assessment
- CVSS scoring
- Risk prioritization
- Business impact
- Likelihood assessment

### Vulnerability Details
- **Description**: What the vulnerability is
- **Impact**: What can be exploited
- **Proof of Concept**: How to reproduce
- **Remediation Recommendations**: How to fix

### Evidence Collection
- Screenshots
- Network captures
- Log files
- Code snippets

## Documentation Best Practices

### Clear and Concise Writing
- Use plain language
- Avoid jargon when possible
- Structure information logically
- Use visual aids

### Risk Prioritization
- Critical vulnerabilities first
- Business impact consideration
- Exploitability assessment
- Remediation effort

### Actionable Recommendations
- Specific remediation steps
- Code examples
- Configuration changes
- Implementation guidance

### Compliance Mapping
- Map findings to compliance requirements
- PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR considerations
- Industry standards alignment

## Reporting Tools
- **Dradis**: Security reporting framework
- **Serpico**: Penetration testing report generator
- **Faraday**: Collaborative penetration testing platform

## Code Examples

### Python Examples
See the `examples/python/` directory for:
- `report_generator.py` - Comprehensive penetration testing report generator

### Node.js Examples
See the `examples/nodejs/` directory for:
- `report_generator.js` - Report generator (Node.js)

### Usage
```bash
# Python
python examples/python/report_generator.py "Client Name" "Project Name"

# Node.js
node examples/nodejs/report_generator.js "Client Name" "Project Name"
```

## Report Templates

The report generator includes:
- Executive summary generation
